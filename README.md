# Brewing Stand Documentation ðŸ“š

Welcome to the **Brewing Stand** documentation page!

## ðŸš§ Work in Progress ðŸš§

This project is currently under development. I'm actively working on creating a powerful tool to help Minecraft modpack developers manage, create, and visualize recipes. Once completed, the documentation will provide all the information you need to set up, use, and contribute to the Brewing Stand project.

### What to Expect

In the future, you can expect detailed guides and resources on:
- **Installation**: Step-by-step instructions for setting up Brewing Stand.
- **Usage**: How to create, edit, and manage recipes within the tool.
- **Supported Mods**: A list of supported recipe types (vanilla and modded).
- **API Documentation**: If applicable, information on any APIs or mod integrations.
- **Contribution Guide**: A full guide for developers who want to contribute to the project.

For now, keep an eye on this space. I will be updating this documentation regularly as development progresses!

Thanks for your interest in Brewing Stand! ðŸš€
